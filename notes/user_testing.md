## Test 1

return to north using a compass

add note: gt = giga tons


fix the year chart, 

we think in terms of calendar time, 
(+150 years from now)

do the widgets interact?
- no, (each widget is independent)
they shouldn't interact because they would
become to weidly

widget1 is too tall,

instructions, so that people can better understand. 

A baseline, if we continue on current trajectory

people only each 100m burgers, but if they eat 200m burgers

Locations:
LA
NY

(choose densest population centers)

Feedback:
Educational tools:
- a simplified version of these widgets

- less severe than expectations. 
- with 2 meters, much more of the duamish covered up.
