w209 plan

- showing each module
create a div for each person
<div id="yang"></div>
then have those display none / display based on the button press

- each module will reference the js from a separate file 
(keeps everything modular and updateable)

- each module should output a number of gigatons
based on user interaction

- the slider should output a number of years

- run an ajax call to output

- update based on the result from the model
