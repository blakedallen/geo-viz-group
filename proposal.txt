W209 Data Visualization 
Fall 2020 – MIDS Program

Week 6 Proposal
●      Names of students in your group (alphabetically by last name)
	Blake Allen
	Tsung-Chin Han
	Yang Jing
        Victor Wang
●      What is your project concept?
➢ To inform users of the economic and social impact of sea level rise across the globe in a direct and visual way. 
➢ Start with an overview of “median case” sea level rise projection by [2100] by [country], with projected impact by country, including GDP, population, agriculture as a % of GDP, etc.
➢ Drill down to a lower level to enable users to play around with different scenarios, such as changing CO2 emission levels and visualize the impact
…
●      Who are your users?
➢ General public mostly, to raise the awareness of the impact of climate changes. 
●      What are some tasks they will do with your visualization?
➢ Hover over the overview charts to see impact by country
➢ Click on a country to drill into details and change the parameters to see other scenarios and the corresponding impact of sea level rise
●      What is an example of an insight that you hope your work will show?
➢ Which countries/states are most vulnerable to sea level rise?
➢ How much difference it will make if sea level rise is 2 feet instead of 6 feet? 
		
●      Where will you get your data?
